                            <br>
                            <br> OutsideIn; aims to take information from sensors, each of which represents an emotion and uses that information to create an emotional diary. The emotional diary displays the time and date the emotion was felt, how many times it was felt and allows the user provide qualitative information about each emotion felt at any given time or date.
                            <br>
                            <br> An Arduino board, tilt switch, flex sensor, potentiometer, resistors, jump wires, a male to male USB, computer and a breadboard were used to record the sensor data for this project.
                            <br>
                            <br>Research reviewed showed that the body language of a happy person becomes erratic, animated and faster than usual, i.e. shaking with excitement or jumping for joy; the tilt switch was used to represent the happy emotion as users could shake the switch to record the feeling. Body language of a person that was anxious or nervous was found to be fidgety, tight and rigid, i.e. fiddling with an object, twiddling fingers or twisting a material (cloth or paper, etc.). The potentiometer was chosen to represent the nervous emotion as users could twist it to record they were nervous.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Sensors also allow the emotion to be recorded at the time the emotion is felt, not after, presenting an accurate portrayal of an individuals mood over time and on a given day.

                                I participated in H.AL.E Brazil, a hackathon for health, assisted living, social care and communities in Brazil.(2016)
                                <br>
                                <br> The application I worked on was a game for children to give insight into the triggers of asthma and what asthma is.
                                <br>
                                <br> The inspiration for the game was derived from my experience with asthma. I have asthma and had asthma as a child, so was able to provide insight into the things I would like to have understood about my condition when I was younger. The hackathon challenged my communication, problem solving and creative thinking skills by forcing me to overcome language barriers and learn cultural customs to produce a technical solution to improve the knowledge of asthma with my Brazilian team members.
                                <br>
                                <br> The members of my team found it difficult to involve me in the problem solving, as they spoke little English. To combat this, I communicated my ideas through visual means: drawing solutions, using symbols and occasionally using Google Translate. To ensure that I contributed, I had to ask questions and put ideas forward, often having to pause the group discussion to make sure everyone was on the same page. My team members also found interesting ways to communicate ideas, acting out ways we could create solutions and helping me expand my Portuguese vocabulary.

                            <a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</a>In 2014 I got the opportunity to volunteer at a local library; where I taught basic IT skills to general members of the public. I worked with a variety of people and learned to modify my approach to communicate effectively; an example of this is where I was working with an elderly learner, who spoke little English. As I am learning new languages I was able to empathise with her, and found that teaching her visually enhanced my communication abilities and her understanding.

                            <p>Intern at DS-Cubed (2016)
                                <br> As an intern at DS-Cubed I worked with a team of designers, coordinators, researchers and developers, to provide software solutions to complex problems.
                                <br>
                                <br>The main problem I worked on was the company website. The old website was not representative of the company and lacked an appealing design. I coordinated a team of designers and project managers and together was able to create new content and ideas for the new site. I held meetings and my team and I worked on finding ideas to create the most maintainable, fast and logical to develop the website. It was decided that Wordpress would be the best content management system to use as all members of the team could be taught how to update the website's content. Having no previous familiarity with Wordpress was an exciting challenge and I utilised the opportunity to learn more about PHP and content management systems. The new website accurately represents the company.<a href="http://ds-cubed.co.uk/">DS-CUBED.CO.UK</a>
